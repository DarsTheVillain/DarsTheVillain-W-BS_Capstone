    <h2>Rider</h2>

    <p>This is the time that me and my partner went to see her old friend and I'm having problem starting the engine.
        I love riding naked bikes as for me it looks cool and the motor vehicle is easy to handle as it has clutch in it.
        I'm not really a fan of automatic motor vehicle.</p>

    <h2>Gym Rat</h2>

    <p>After going to gym I have to report to work so I went to my work office and just take some shower before I start working.
        This happens everytime that I'm going to the gym so I have to always bring clothes with me aside from the one that I'm using during that time.

    <h2>Traveller</h2>

    <p>I love going to safe places where there is peace and the nature is so pure that there's no stain of modern world.
        Hopefully one day I can visit more places without thinking of the amount of money that I will spend.</p>
